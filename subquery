Types of subqueries in SQL.

ðŸ’¡A subquery, is a query placed within another SQL query.

Â·     A subquery may occur in:
â€¢ SELECT clause
â€¢ FROM clause
â€¢ WHERE clause

Â·     Subquery can be nested inside a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement or inside another subquery.
 
ðŸ’¡Types of Subqueries:
1. Single Row Subquery - Returns zero or one row in results.
2. Multiple Row Subquery - Returns one or more rows in results.
3. Multiple Column Subqueries - Returns one or more columns
4. Correlated Subqueries - Returns one or more columns according to the main or the outer query, thus called a correlated subquery.
5. Nested Subqueries - We have multiple subqueries within a query (like a nested loop).
